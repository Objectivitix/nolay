# Nolay: Simple and intensive goal management app

**lay (verb)**:\
to cease advancement, to lay down and stay;\
to some, peace with the world; to others, complacency.

For those in the latter group,\
For those unsatisfied,\
For those who desire more,\
For those seeking greatness:\
Give me a try, for I am perchance the regimen you need.

**Nolay is a medium-term goalsetter.** Start not laying in 5 simple steps:

1. Think about the aspects of your life. Define your Projects.
2. Set a Month Goal for each Project.
3. Set Week Goals to complete each Month Goal.
4. Set Daily Tasks to complete each Week Goal.
5. Commit and achieve.

**Nolay is flexible.** Achieve in your way:

- Want less rigour? Don't set Daily Tasks.
- Need a reminder? Write a Note.
- On the go? Use the convenient mobile interface.

> One day of not laying, one step closer to success.

(But don't **curl** either. [Black Swan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)>) learned that the hard way.)
