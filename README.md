# Nolay: Simple and intensive goal management app

**lay (verb)**:\
to cease advancement, to lay down and stay;\
to some, peace with the world; to others, complacency.

For those in the latter group,\
For those unsatisfied,\
For those who desire more,\
For those seeking greatness:\
Give me a try, for I am perchance the regimen you need.

**Nolay is a medium-term goalsetter.** Start not laying in 5 simple steps:

1. Think about the aspects of your life. Define your Projects.
2. Set a Month Goal for each Project.
3. Set Week Goals to complete each Month Goal.
4. Set Daily Tasks to complete each Week Goal.
5. Commit and achieve.

**Nolay is flexible.** Achieve in your way:

- Want less rigour? Don't set Daily Tasks.
- Need a reminder? Write a Note.
- On the go? Use the convenient mobile interface.

> One day of not laying, one step closer to success.

\- Einstein, probably

(But don't **curl** either. [Black Swan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)>) learned that the hard way.)

## Development Notes

> The iterator is antifragile.

\- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, probably

Recently I was touched by the idea that it's often better to complete several projects than to spend too much time crafting one to perfection. I think this applies all too well to webdev. Nolay has been stuck in development hell for two months, so it's time to move on, albeit all its (my perceived) imperfections.
